# NowSecure Action v2  
  
The primary advantage of migrating from v1 to v2 is flexibility. It is possible to perform operations with the created Report ID, as well as utilize GitHub Environments to reduce billable minutes.  
  
Given a configuration similar to:  
  
```
name: NowSecure  
uses: nowsecure/nowsecure-action@v1  
timeout-minutes: 60  
with:  
    token: ${{ secrets.NS_TOKEN }} 
    app_file: YOUR_APP_FILE
    group_id: YOUR_GROUP_ID
  
name: Upload SARIF file  
uses: github/codeql-action/upload-sarif@v1  
with:  
    sarif_file: NowSecure.sarif  
```
  
Rewrite your configuration as follows:  
  
```
id: upload
name: NowSecure Upload App  
uses: nowsecure/nowsecure-action/upload-app@v2  
with:  
    token: ${{ secrets.NS_TOKEN }}
    app_file: YOUR_APP_FILE
    group_id: YOUR_GROUP_ID
  
id: pull_report
name: NowSecure Convert SARIF  
uses: nowsecure/nowsecure-action/convert-sarif@v2  
timeout-minutes: 60  
with:  
   report_id: ${{ steps.upload.outputs.report_id }}
   token: ${{ secrets.NS_TOKEN }}
   group_id: YOUR_GROUP_ID
  
name: Upload SARIF file  
uses: github/codeql-action/upload-sarif@v1  
with:  
    sarif_file: NowSecure.sarif

```
