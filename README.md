# `nowsecure-action`

The `nowsecure-action` delivers fast, accurate, automated security analysis of iOS and Android apps coded in any language.

**Features**:

- Integrates with [GitHub Advanced Security](https://docs.github.com/en/get-started/learning-about-github/about-github-advanced-security) (GHAS) to display issues and remediation information inside of GitHub code scanning alerts,
- Optionally break builds that introduce new alerts,
- Run scans for each commit, or periodically,
- And more;

### Prerequisites

- To use this action an active NowSecure Platform account is required. If you ***are not*** an existing NowSecure Platform customer, please [contact us](https://info.nowsecure.com/github-request).
- An active GitHub account (cloud or on-prem) with an active Advanced Security feature

### GitHub Marketplace Setup (recommended)

Click the "Security" tab in your repository (GHAS must be enabled) then "Set up code scanning" then select the NowSecure action from the marketplace and follow the listed instructions.

### Setting up this Action

- First, generate your NowSecure platform token. 
  - To generate a token, in the UI, go to the "Profile & Preferences"  page and click “Create Token”
- Then, In the repository settings, set up a new  NS_TOKEN token by clicking "Secrets" and then "New repository secret"
- Next, copy the group ID for the group you would like to pull from
  - To find your group ID, in the UI, go to your app’s “Package Details” page and copy the Group ID by hovering over the group name
- Lastly, enable scanning alerts in GitHub. 
  - Click the "Security" tab in your repository (GHAS must be enabled) then "Set up code scanning" then select the NowSecure action from the marketplace and follow the listed instructions.

### Required Configuration

For an _existing_ workflow,

The action must be run on an `ubuntu-latest` GitHub Action runner.

> Note: For line-of-code identification, `ripgrep` must be available in the runner. For Ubuntu images, add a step for `apt-get install -y ripgrep`.

After the application build step run the NowSecure action and upload the SARIF to GHAS:

```yml
- name: NowSecure
  uses: nowsecure/nowsecure-action@v1
  timeout-minutes: 60
  with:
    token: ${{ secrets.NS_TOKEN }}
    app_file: $APPLICATION_PATH		# REPLACE: The path to an .ipa or .apk
    group_id: $GROUP_ID				# REPLACE: NowSecure Group ID

- name: Upload SARIF file
  uses: github/codeql-action/upload-sarif@v1
  with:
    path: NowSecure.sarif
```

For a _new_ workflow,

Add a new file called `nowsecure.yml` in your `.github/workflows` folder and review the [example](https://github.com/nowsecure/nowsecure-action/blob/main/workflows/nowsecure.yml).

### Custom Configuration (Optional)

An `.nsconfig.yml` file in the root of the repo allows you to configure a minimum-severity filter (the default is medium which includes critical, high, and medium findings), a list of [checkIds](src/utils/config-types.ts) to include, as well as a list of [checkIds](https://github.com/nowsecure/nowsecure-action/blob/main/workflows/nowsecure.yml) to exclude from the code scanning alerts.

```yml
minimum-severity: high # Can be one of [critical, high, medium, low, info]
include-checks:
  - apk_hardcoded_keys
  - apk_weak_crypto_methods
exclude-checks:
  - android_janus_warn
```
